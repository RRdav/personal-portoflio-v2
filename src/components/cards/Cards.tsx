                        I am currently working as a Junior Web Developer at Jala Design, where I am involved in developing and maintaining web applications using PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL. My role includes collaborating with the backend team to ensure WooCommerce integrations, plugins, and custom functions work properly.
                        I also work in website projects I am assigned in to integrate PHP and JavaScript code, ensuring that the front-end and back-end systems work seamlessly together. I am also responsible for debugging and troubleshooting issues that arise in the development process.
